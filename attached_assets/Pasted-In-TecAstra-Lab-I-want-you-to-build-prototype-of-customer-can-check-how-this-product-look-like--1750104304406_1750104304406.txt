TecAstra FortIQ — Cloud-Native Next-Gen Firewall (NGFW)
 
❓Why FortIQ First?
1. High Market Demand:
Every business, from startup to enterprise, needs a firewall. They’re the entry point for security budgets.
2. Recurring Revenue:
Firewall-as-a-service (FWaaS) enables SaaS pricing, upgrades, and long-term subscriptions.
3. Ecosystem Foundation:
Once deployed, it becomes a platform — your other tools (DNS, EDR, ZTNA) will integrate into it later.
4. You Can Outperform Incumbents:
Cisco and Palo Alto are hardware-heavy, bloated, and complex. You’ll build:
•	100% cloud-native
•	Agentless if possible
•	Intuitive dashboard
•	Zero-touch setup for SMEs
 
✅ WHAT IS FORTIQ?
FortIQ is a cloud-native next-gen firewall that:
•	Filters traffic by app, port, IP, behavior, and identity
•	Blocks known and emerging threats with ML-powered rules
•	Scales instantly for any cloud/hybrid environment
•	Provides rich analytics + threat intel
•	Offers real-time visibility + control
 
🧠 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
🔧 Modules
Module	Purpose
Traffic Engine	Ingests & processes inbound/outbound traffic
Policy Engine	Enforces firewall rules (app, IP, time, etc.)
Threat Detection Engine	ML-based anomaly detection, signature matching
Rule Manager UI	Web interface to create, view, apply policies
Analytics + Logging	Real-time and historical dashboards
Integration Layer	API hooks to other TecAstra tools (future)
🌐 Deployment Options
•	VPC-deployable container (AWS/GCP/Azure)
•	Edge gateway plugin
•	Kubernetes sidecar version
•	Clientless traffic mirror (SPAN port-style for observation)
 
💡 KEY FEATURES (MVP VERSION)
Feature	Description	Why It's Important
✅ Rule-Based Filtering	Allow/deny by IP, port, protocol, geolocation	Basic firewall functionality
✅ Application Awareness	Identify apps (e.g., Dropbox, Zoom)	Stops evasive traffic
✅ Threat Blocking	Blocks malware, phishing, known IPs	Core security need
✅ Traffic Insights	Bandwidth, destination, anomaly graphs	Visibility for admins
✅ Logs + Export	JSON + CSV export, syslog-compatible	SOC integration
✅ Policy Templates	Prebuilt rules for web, DBs, RDP, etc.	Fast onboarding
✅ Cloud Console	Web-based UI with auth + RBAC	No hardware or install needed
